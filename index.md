## **Intuitive data visualization and em-POWERing insights.**

### Project Summary
The goal of this project is to provide insight into power consumption in order to significantly decrease its usage. Our system would be able to show its users the rooms or areas that are using the most electricity. This can be used to identify and prioritize upgrades to high consumption areas. Also, making individuals aware of this data would not only save the environment, but also their budgets.

Our goal was to find a project that raises awareness for power consumption. We discovered that most people are not very careful about the power that they use. Numerous people, after moving off campus, realized that their habits affected their power usage. Our project aims to be a tool that will help individuals find inefficiencies with their consumption habits.

Even though there are many tools similar to ours on the market, most are expensive enough to make them impractical and most do not offer many of the features of our project. Our goal is to have a design that is affordable, so that it will be easy and inexpensive for people to keep track of their power consumption.

### Project Code
There are three main important repositories. The project descriptions and links are listed below.
